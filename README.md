# Hangman-game

This is a hangman game coded in Python. The wordlist is stored in a words.txt file. In this file, for example, there are some Dutch city names. The wordlist can be manipulated freely, but two things should be mentioned: 

1. Capital letters and lower case letters are both fine when adding new words to the wordlist.
2. Only letters are considered, please do not add any word that contains a dash, for example, "re-elected".

Please put the words.txt file in the same directory as the hangman.py file, otherwise you should change the path to load the wordlist file in the hangman.py
